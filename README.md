HYPOTHESIS:
Solar energy potential is positively correlated with the average time when the Sun is located in the sky and negatively correlated with the average amount of rain annually. However, there is no significant correlation with average temperature and snowy conditions. Therefore, Solar power infrastructure should also be supported in respectively cold regions for the social good of Turkey.

Aim of this project: Analyzing the factors that influence solar power potential can help improve energy access and affordability. Understanding the relationship between climatic factors and solar power generation allows for better planning and decision-making regarding the deployment of solar energy systems. This can lead to increased access to affordable and reliable electricity for communities and households, especially in remote or underserved areas. In addition to that,  our Project supports the sustainable development goals of Turkey. It enables the adoption of clean energy technologies, stimulates economic growth, creates employment opportunities in the renewable energy sector, and improves living standards while minimizing the negative impacts on the environment. Therefore, our project’s aim is to drive positive change, promote sustainability, increase energy access, and mitigate climate change. 

We extracted data from: https://www.mgm.gov.tr/veridegerlendirme/il-ve-ilceler-istatistik.aspx?k=undefined&m= then we pre-processed and made an exploratory data analysis. We separated data into labels and features for the maching learning part. Finally, we used different regression models to test our model.
